# Introduction to Pandas

Pandas is a powerful and open-source Python library. This library is used for data manipulation and analysis of data sets.
It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. Pandas consist of data structures and functions to perform efficient operations on data.

# What is Python Pandas used for?

The Pandas library is generally used for data science. This is because the Pandas library is used in conjunction with other libraries that are used for data science.
It is built on top of the NumPy library which means that a lot of the structures of NumPy are used or replicated in Pandas.
The data produced by Pandas is often used as input for plotting functions in Matplotlib, statistical analysis in SciPy, and machine learning algorithms in Scikit-learn.
#### Why should you use the Pandas Library?
-Python’s Pandas library is the best tool to analyze, clean, and manipulate data.

## List of uses of Pandas:

1. Data set cleaning, merging, and joining.
2. Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data.
3. Columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher-dimensional objects.
4. Powerful group by functionality for performing split-apply-combine operations on data sets.
5. Data Visualization

# Getting Started with Pandas
Let’s see how to start working with the Python Pandas library:

## Installing Pandas
The first step in working with Pandas is to ensure whether it is installed in the system or not.  If not, then we need to install it on our system using the pip command.

Follow these steps to install Pandas:

Step 1: Open the Command prompt shell
Step 2: Locate the folder where the python-pip file has been installed.
Step 3: After locating it, type the command:
       `pip install pandas`

## Importing Pandas
After the Pandas have been installed in the system, you need to import the library. This module is generally imported as follows:

`import pandas as pd`
